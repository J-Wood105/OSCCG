Welcome To The Open Source Collectable Card Game
=====
## The Idea:
Create a digital collectable card game using the power of the open source community. This is not just for the code of the game, but to the development of the game's design, mechanics, cards, art work and more.

## Certain Constraints
- Accessible
  - The development of this game, the game play and ability to play will and should remain as accessible as possible.
  - Initial thoughts:
    - Built with ability to play in a browser on a phone.
    - Use as much web accessability that is available for HTML5 Canvas games
- Inclusive
  - Every opinion matters and should be heard out, discussed and decided upon by either committee or majority
  - The game subject matter, design, mechanics, etc. should not be exclusive.
- Card Based Game
  - Defence for this: I think making this a card game allows for more creativity, ease of creating assets and more. I'm open to discussion of this changing.

## Theme/Universe Options

- Fantasy
  - Pros:
    - Lots of content to pull from and use
  - Cons:
    - Done before and already used in many card games
- Hacker/Developer/Start-up (may move this idea to similar but different project)
  - Pros:
    - Possibility for great and hilarious cards. Think "Rock Star Developer", "Daily Stand up", etc.
    - Could lead to interesting gaming Mechanics
    - players could be called "Founders" or something similar
  - Cons:
    - Large possibility for excluding many people who would otherwise play or contribute to the project.
    - Possibility that the content would be limited and played out quickly
- Cyberpunk/Retro futuristic
  - Pros:
    - Lots of content to pull from and endless possibilities for new content.
    - Could lead to really creative cards, content and game mechanics
  - Cons:
    - I'm not sure yet, but let's talk about it
- Fantasy Cyberpunk
  - Pros
    - similar to both cyberpunk and fantasy
    - ability to use "mana" or other such magic for card / card ability costs
  - Cons:
    - Not sure yet
- Steampunk
  - Pros:
    - Similar to cyberpunk
  - Cons:
    - not sure yet
- Interdimensional collapse (a.k.a. all of the above and more)
  - Pros:
    - LOTS of content and possibility for creative game play
  - Cons:
    - could be really hard to ballance

## Game Play

Currently pulling ideas from games like Magic the Gathering and Hearthstone.
- Cards or their abilities should have some kind of cost to them.
- ability to earn in game currency to be used to get packs, cards or decks
  - NO ACTUAL REAL MONEY CAN OR WILL BE USED TO BUY THIS IN GAME CURRENCY!
- Should be able to have a game mode that allows for playing against a bot, real person, and multi-player
