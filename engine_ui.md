## HTML5 Game Engine
### Pros
- Likely best case for most polish.
- More likely to have similar game play, UI, and animation as other games like Magic Arena, Hearthstone, Pok√©mon Online.
- Possibly better for creatives/digital artists and those already doing game development
### Cons
- Possibly high barrier to entry for web or other developers.
- Could potentially be a lot to load for lower end devices.
- There are many engines to choose from, all with their own costs and benefits.

## JavaScrip Framework
### Pros
- Potentially easy to setup (though maybe hard to maintain later?)
- lower barrier to entry for those currently doing web development
### Cons
- higher barrier to entry for game developers and digital artists
- Lots of frameworks to choose from, all with their own costs and benefits.

## Plain JavaScript
### Pros
- potentially lowest barrier to entry for all developers.
### Cons
- development time may take much longer.
